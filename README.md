# 💻 **Software Engineer | Web Developer ** 🌐

Hi! I'm a software developer student from LUT nearing the end of my studies. My main focus and passion is **frontend web development** since I enjoy good looking things, but I also happen to know a thing or two about **backend development** as well. Sometimes I dabble in game development with Gamemaker. In addition, I have a strong foundation on important software development concepts such as UX/UI design, version control, collaboration, software quality, security, maintenance and much more!
